			<h1>Dealing with feelings</h1>
		</header>
		<p>As you progress in your recovery, you may notice unaccustomed emotions and feelings beginning to ­surface. This is particularly true if you’re beginning to confront your phobias. It’s entirely ­normal to ­experience feelings more intensely when you begin to face situations you’ve been ­avoiding for a long time. If this is happening to you, you’re on the right track.</p>
		<p>Many people who are phobic and prone to anxiety tend to have difficulty with feelings. You may have a problem just knowing what you’re feeling. Or you may be able to identify your ­feelings but unable to express them. When feelings begin to come up in the course of facing phobias or dealing with panic, there is often a tendency to withhold them, which only aggravates your stress and anxiety. The purposes of this reading are 1) to help you to increase your awareness of feelings and 2) to give you some tools and strategies for identifying and expressing them more readily.</p>
		<h2>Facts about feelings</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Feelings, unlike thoughts, involve a <em>total body reaction</em>. They are mediated both by a part of your brain called the limbic system and by the involuntary, autonomic nervous system in your body. When you’re emotionally excited, you "feel it all over" and experience bodily reactions such as increased heart rate, quickened respiration, perspiration, and even shaking or ­trembling (note the similarity to panic, which is another type of intense emotional state).</li>
			<li>Feelings do not come out of the blue but are <em>influenced by your thoughts and perceptions</em>. They arise from the way you perceive or interpret outer events and/or the way you react to your own inner thought processes or "self-talk" (see the "Self-talk" reading), imagery, or memories. If you can’t identify a stimulus for a particular emotional reaction (for example, a spontaneous panic attack), that stimulus may be unconscious. Feelings are also affected by stress. When you’re under stress, your body is already in a state of physiological arousal similar to that which accompanies an emotion. Since you’re already primed to have ­emotional reactions, it may not take much to set you off. The particular type of emotion you happen to experience will depend on your view of external events and what you tell yourself about them.</li>
			<li>Feelings can be divided into two groups—simple and complex. There is much controversy and disagreement about how to do this—and even whether it can be done—but for our purposes here, a distinction will be made between basic emotions such as anger, grief, ­sadness, fear, love, excitement, or joy, and more complex feelings such as eagerness, relief, disappointment, or impatience. Complex feelings may involve a combination of more basic emotions and are also shaped by thoughts and imagery. Many of the feelings on The Feeling List presented later in this chapter are complex. Complex feelings can last a long time and are more tied to thought processes, while basic emotions tend to be short-lived, more reactive, and more tied to involuntary physical reactions mediated by the autonomic nervous system. Fear or panic is a basic emotion, while free-floating anxiety (anxiety ­without an object) is an example of a more complex feeling.</li>
			<li>Feelings are what give you energy. If you’re in touch with your feelings and can express them, you’ll feel more energetic. If you’re out of touch with your feelings or unable to give them expression, you may feel lethargic, numb, tired, or depressed. As you’ll see shortly, blocked or withheld feelings can lead to anxiety.</li>
			<li>Feelings often come in mixtures rather than in pure form. Sometimes you may experience a ­simple, basic emotion such as fear, sadness, or rage. More often, though, you’ll find that you feel two or more emotions at the same time. For example, it’s common to feel anger and fear at the same time when you’re threatened. Or you may feel anger, guilt, and love all at the same time in response to arguing with your partner, parent, or close friend. The common expression sorting out feelings reflects the fact that you can feel several things at once.</li>
			<li>Feelings are often contagious. If you’re close to someone who is crying, you may start to feel sad or even cry yourself. Or you may pick up on another’s excitement or enthusiasm. Phobic and anxiety-prone individuals are often particularly susceptible to taking on the feelings of people around them. The more you learn to be in touch with and comfortable with your own feelings, the less prone you’ll be to "catch" those of others.</li>
			<li>Feelings are not right or wrong. As reactions, feelings simply exist. Fear, joy, guilt, and anger are not in and of themselves valid or invalid—you just happen to have these ­feelings and usually will feel better if you can express them. The perceptions or judgments you made that led to your feelings, however, may be right or wrong, valid or invalid. Be careful not to make yourself or anyone else wrong for simply having a feeling, whatever that feeling may be.</li>
			<li>Feelings are often subject to suppression. Sometimes you may actively control or "hold in" your feelings. For example, you’re still upset from an argument with your spouse and then you have to talk to a colleague at work. You deliberately and consciously hold back your feelings, because you know that it would be inappropriate for them to carry over into your work situation. On other occasions, you may start to experience feelings that are unpleasant and decide that you don’t want to deal with them. Instead of deliberately suppressing them, you just get busy and put your mind on something else—in essence you ignore them. This avoidance or evasion of feelings is a subtler form of suppression (which some people speak of as "repression"). Over time, the practice of continually suppressing your feelings can lead to increased difficulty in expressing or even identifying them.* When the process of suppression begins in childhood, you tend to grow up being out of touch with your feelings and going through life experiencing a certain numbness or "emptiness."</li>
