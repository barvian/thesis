		<h1>Stopping Obsessive Worrying</h1>
	</header>
	<article>
		<p>Obsessive worry is like a negative spiral. The longer you spend time with it, the deeper into it you can get. It may also be viewed as a form of trance. The more you induce it by repetition, the more entranced you get, and the more difficult it may be to "break the spell."</p>
		<p><em>It takes a deliberate act of will to stop it</em>. You need to make a deliberate effort to move away from circular mental activity and get out of your head by "shifting gears" to another modality of experience, such as bodily activity, expressing emotions, interpersonal communication, sensory distraction, or a specific ritual. (In some cases, an alternative obsession will do.)</p>
		<p>The downward pull of an obsessive spiral can be very compelling. Following the path of least resistance is likely to keep you going round and round. Although deliberately choosing to break out of the obsessive thinking may be difficult at first (especially if you’re highly anxious), with practice it will get easier.</p>
		<p>Below are some examples of alternative activities and experiences that can help you shift out of your mind and away from obsessive thinking.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Do physical exercise. This can be your favorite outdoor or indoor exercise, dancing, or just household chores.</li>
			<li>Do progressive muscle relaxation alone or in combination with abdominal breathing. The Relax tab is here for this reason. Keep this up for five to ten minutes until you feel fully relaxed and freer from obsessive thoughts.</li>
			<li>Use evocative music to release repressed feelings. Such feelings—usually sadness or anger—may underlie and "drive" worry or obsessive thinking.</li>
			<li>Talk to someone. Converse about something other than the worry, unless you want to express your feelings about it, as in point 3.</li>
			<li>Use visual distractions. This can be TV, movies, video games, your computer, uplifting reading, or even a rock garden.</li>
			<li>Use sensory-motor distraction. Try arts and crafts, repairing something, or gardening.</li>
			<li>Find an alternative, positive obsession. For example, work out a crossword or jigsaw puzzle.</li>
			<li>Practice healthy rituals. Combine abdominal breathing with a positive affirmation that has personal significance. Keep this up for five to ten minutes, or until you’re fully relaxed. (This is actually a positive trance induction to overcome the negative trance enforced by the obsessive worry.)</li>
