	<h1>Mistaken Beliefs</h1>
	<p>By now you may have asked, "Where does negative self-talk come from?" In most cases, it’s ­possible to trace negative thinking back to deeper-lying beliefs or assumptions about ourselves, others, and life in ­general. These basic assumptions have been variously called "scripts," "core beliefs," "life decisions," "­fallacious beliefs," or "mistaken beliefs." While growing up, we learned them from our parents, teachers, and peers, as well as from the larger society around us. These beliefs are typically so basic to our thinking that we do not recognize them as beliefs at all—we just take them for granted and assume them to reflect reality. Examples of mistaken beliefs that you might hold are "I’m powerless," "Life is a struggle," or "I should always look good and act nice, no matter how I feel." There is nothing new about the idea of ­mistaken beliefs—they are a part of what people have in mind when they refer to your "attitude" or "outlook."</p>
	<p>Mistaken beliefs are at the root of much of the anxiety you experience. As discussed in the preceding chapter, you talk yourself into much of your anxiety by anticipating the worst (what-if thinking), ­putting yourself down (self-critical thinking), and pushing yourself to meet unreasonable demands and expectations (perfectionist thinking). Underlying these destructive patterns of self-talk are some basic false assumptions about yourself and "the way life is."</p>
	<p>You could save yourself quite a bit of worrying, for example, if you let go of the basic assumption, "I must worry about a problem before there’s any chance it will go away." Similarly, you would feel more confident and secure if you discarded the mistaken belief "I’m nothing unless I succeed" or "I’m nothing unless others love and approve of me." Once again, life would be less stressful and tense if you would let go of the belief "I must do it perfectly or it’s not worth bothering to try." You can go a long way toward creating a less anxious way of life by working on changing the basic assumptions that tend to perpetuate anxiety.</p>
	<p>Mistaken beliefs often keep you from achieving your most important goals in life. You might ask yourself right now, "What is it that I really want out of life? What would I attempt to do if I knew I could not fail?" Take a few minutes to seriously reflect on this and write your answer in the space below. (Use a separate sheet of paper if you need more room.)</p>
	<p>Now, if you don’t yet have what you want, ask yourself the simple question, "Why not?" List what reasons you can come up with in the space below or write them on another sheet of paper.</p>
	<p>In the process of doing the above exercise, you may have discovered certain beliefs or assumptions that have been holding you back. Are these assumptions truly valid? Examples of assumptions that ­people hold themselves back with might include "I can’t afford to have what I want," "I don’t have the time to go back to school and study the subject that interests me," or "I don’t have the talent to ­succeed." At a more unconscious level, you might even feel "I don’t deserve to have what I truly want." None of these ideas necessarily reflects the true nature of ­reality—they all involve assumptions that might well turn out to be false if actually tested. Often you don’t realize how such assumptions are ­affecting your behavior until someone else points them out to you.</p>
	<p>Mistaken beliefs often set limits on your self-esteem and self-worth. Many such beliefs involve the idea that your self-worth depends on something outside yourself, such as social status, wealth, material possessions, the love of another person, or social approval in general. If you don’t have these things, somehow you believe that you are not worth much. The belief that "Success is everything" or "My worth depends on what I accomplish" places the basis of your self-esteem outside of you. So does the belief "I’m nothing unless I’m loved (or approved of)."</p>
	<p>The truth that takes some people a long time to realize is that self-worth is inherent. You have an essential value, worth, and dignity just by virtue of the fact that you’re a human being. You have many qualities and talents, regardless of your outer accomplishments or the approval of ­others. Without ­thinking, we respect the inherent value of dogs and cats as animals. So, too, human beings have inherent value just as they are, apart from what they accomplish, what they possess, or whose approval they enjoy. As you grow in self-esteem, you can learn to respect and believe in yourself apart from what you have accomplished and without relying on others for your good feeling (or making others reliant on you).</p>
	<h2>Examples</h2>
	<p>There are innumerable mistaken beliefs. You have your own collection as a result of what you learned from your parents, teachers, and peers during childhood and adolescence. Sometimes you take on a false belief directly from your parents, such as when you are told "Big boys don’t cry" or "Nice girls don’t get angry." At other times, you develop "an attitude about yourself as a result of being frequently criticized (thus "I’m worthless"), ignored (thus "My needs don’t matter"), or rejected (thus "I’m unlovable") over many years. The unfortunate thing is that you may live out these mistaken attitudes to the point where you act in ways—and get others to treat you in ways—that confirm them. Like computers, people can be "preprogrammed," and the mistaken beliefs of childhood can become self-fulfilling prophecies.</p>
	<p>Below are some examples of fairly common mistaken beliefs that tend to influence many ­people. Following each are counterstatements that replace the negative belief with a positive one, much in the way negative self-talk was countered by positive self-statements in the preceding chapter. Positive statements that counter mistaken beliefs are known as affirmations.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>I’m powerless. I’m a victim of outside circumstances.</dt>
		<dd>I’m responsible and in control of my life. Circumstances are what they are, but I can determine my attitude toward them.</dd>
		<dt>Life is a struggle. Something must be wrong if life seems too easy, pleasurable, or fun.</dt>
		<dd>Life is full and pleasurable. It’s okay for me to relax and have fun. Life is an adventure—and I’m learning to accept both the ups and the downs.</dd>
		<dt>If I take a risk, I’ll fail. If I fail, others will reject me.</dt>
		<dd>It’s okay for me to take risks. It’s okay to fail—I can learn a lot from every mistake. It’s okay for me to be a success.</dd>
