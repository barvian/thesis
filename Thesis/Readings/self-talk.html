		<h1>Self-Talk</h1>
	</header>
	<article>
		<p>Imagine two individuals sitting in stop-and-go traffic at rush hour. One perceives himself as trapped, and says such things to himself as "I can’t stand this," "I’ve got to get out of here," and "Why did I ever get myself into this commute?" What he feels is anxiety, anger, and frustration. The other perceives the situation as an opportunity to lie back, relax, and listen to music. He says, "I might as well just relax and adjust to the pace of the traffic" or "I can unwind by doing some deep breathing." What he feels is a sense of calm and acceptance. In both cases, the situation is exactly the same, but the feelings in response to that situation are vastly different because of each individual’s internal monologue, or self-talk.</p>
		<p>The truth is that it’s what we say to ourselves in response to any particular situation that mainly determines our mood and feelings. Often we say it so quickly and automatically that we don’t even notice, and so we get the impression that the external situation "makes" us feel the way we do. But it’s really our interpretations and thoughts about what is happening that form the basis of our feelings. This sequence can be represented as a timeline:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>External events</li>
			<li>Interpretation of Events and Self-Talk</li>
			<li>Feelings and Reactions</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In short, you are largely responsible for how you feel (barring physiological determinants, such as illness). This is a profound and very important truth—one that sometimes takes a long time to fully grasp. It’s often much easier to blame the way you feel on something or someone ­outside yourself than to take responsibility for your reactions. Yet it is through your willingness to accept that responsibility that you begin to take charge and have mastery over your life. The ­realization that you are mostly responsible for how you feel is empowering once you fully accept it. It’s one of the most important keys to living a happier, more effective, and anxiety-free life.</p>
		<h2>Anxiety and self-talk</h2>
		<p>People who suffer from phobias, panic attacks, and general anxiety are especially prone to engage in ­negative self-talk. Anxiety can be generated on the spur of the moment by repeatedly making statements to yourself that begin with the two words "what if." Any anxiety you experience in anticipation of ­confronting a difficult situation is manufactured out of your own "what-if statements" to yourself. When you decide to avoid a situation altogether, it is probably because of the scary questions you’ve asked yourself: "What if I panic?" "What if I can’t handle it?" "What will other people think if they see me anxious?" Just noticing when you fall into "what-if thinking" is the first step toward gaining control over negative self-talk. The real change occurs when you begin to counter and replace negative "what-if statements" with positive, self-­supportive statements that ­reinforce your ability to cope. For example, you might say, "So what," "These are just thoughts," "This is just scare-talk," "I can handle this," or "I can breathe, let go, and relax.</p>
		<p>I want you to consider some basic facts about self-talk. Following these facts is a discussion of the different types of self-defeating inner monologues.</p>
		<h2>Some basic points about self-talk</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Self-talk is usually so automatic and subtle that you don’t notice it or the effect it has on your moods and feelings. You react without noticing what you told yourself right before you reacted. Often it’s only when you relax, take a step back, and really examine what you’ve been telling yourself that you can see the connection between self-talk and your feelings. What is important is that you can learn to slow down and take note of your negative internal monologue.</li>
			<li>Self-talk often appears in telegraphic form. One short word or image contains a whole series of thoughts, memories, or associations. For example, you feel your heart starting to beat faster and say to yourself, "Oh no!" Implicit within that momentary "Oh no!" is a whole series of associations concerning fears about panic, memories of previous panic attacks, and thoughts about how to escape the current situation. Identifying self-talk may require unraveling several distinct thoughts from a single word or image.</li>
			<li>Anxious self-talk is typically irrational but almost always sounds like the truth. What-if thinking may lead you to expect the worst possible outcome in a given situation, one that is highly unlikely to occur. Yet because the association takes place so quickly, it goes unchallenged and unquestioned. It’s hard to evaluate the validity of a belief you’re scarcely aware of—you just accept it as is.</li>
			<li>Negative self-talk perpetuates avoidance. You tell yourself that a situation such as the freeway is dangerous and so you avoid it. By continuing to avoid it, you reinforce the thought that it’s dangerous. You may even project images of catastrophe around the prospect of confronting the situation. In short, anxious self-talk leads to avoidance, avoidance begets further anxious self-talk, and around and around the cycle goes.</li>
			<li>Self-talk can initiate or aggravate a panic attack. A panic attack often starts out with symptoms of increasing physiological arousal, such as a more rapid heartbeat, ­tightness in the chest, or sweaty palms. Biologically, this is the body’s natural response to stress—the fight-or-flight response that all mammals, including humans, ­normally experience when subjected to a perceived threat. There is nothing inherently abnormal or dangerous about it. Yet these symptoms can remind you of previous panic attacks. Instead of simply allowing your body’s physiological reaction to rise, peak, and subside in its own good time, you scare yourself into a considerably more intense panic attack with scary self-talk: "Oh no, it’s ­hap"pening again," "What if I lose control?" "I have to get out of here now," or "I’m going to fight this and make it go away." This scare-talk aggravates the initial physical symptoms, which in turn elicits further scare-talk. A severe panic attack might have been aborted or rendered much less intense had you made reassuring statements to yourself at the onset of your first symptoms: "I can accept what’s happening even though it’s uncomfortable," "I’ll let my body do its thing," "This will pass," "I’ve gotten through this before and I will this time," or "This is just a burst of adrenaline that can metabolize and pass in a few minutes."</li>
			<li>Negative self-talk is a series of bad habits. You aren’t born with a predisposition to fearful self-talk: you learn to think that way. Just as you can replace unhealthy behavioral habits, such as smoking or drinking excess coffee, with more positive, health-promoting behavior, so can you replace unhealthy thinking with more positive, supportive mental habits. Bear in mind that the acquisition of positive mental habits takes the same persistence and practice required for learning new behaviors.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Types of negative self-talk</h2>
		<p>Not all negative self-talk is the same. Human beings are not only diverse but complex, with ­multifaceted personalities. These facets are sometimes referred to as "subpersonalities." Our different subpersonalities each play their own distinct role and possess their own voice in the complex workings of consciousness, memory, and dreams. Below I’ve outlined four of the more common subpersonality types that tend to be prominent in people who are prone to anxiety: the Worrier, the Critic, the Victim, and the Perfectionist.* Since the strength of these inner voices varies for ­different people, you might find it useful to rank them from strongest to weakest in yourself.
		<h3>The Worrier (promotes anxiety)</h3>
		<p><em>Characteristics:</em> This usually is the strongest subpersonality in people who are prone to ­anxiety. The Worrier creates anxiety by imagining the worst-case scenario. It scares you with ­fantasies of disaster or catastrophe when you imagine confronting something you fear. It also aggravates panic by reacting to the first physical symptoms of a panic attack. The Worrier ­promotes your fears that what is happening is dangerous or embarrassing ("What if I have a heart attack?!" "What will they think if they see me?!").</p>
		<p>In short, the Worrier’s dominant tendencies include 1) anticipating the worst, 2) overestimating the odds of something bad or embarrassing happening, and 3) creating grandiose images of potential ­failure or catastrophe. The Worrier is always vigilant, watching with uneasy apprehension for any small symptoms or signs of trouble.</p>
		<p><em>Favorite expression:</em> By far the favorite expression of the Worrier is "what if ...?".</p>
		<p><em>Examples:</em> Some typical dialogue from the Worrier might be: "Oh no, my heart’s starting to beat faster! What if I panic and lose complete control of myself?" "What if I start stammering in the middle of my speech?" "What if they see me shaking?" "What if I’m alone and there’s nobody to call?" "What if I just can’t get over this phobia?" or "What if I’m restricted from going to work for the rest of my life?</p>
		<h3>The Critic (promotes low self-esteem)</h3>
		<p><em>Characteristics:</em> The Critic is that part of you that is constantly judging and evaluating your ­behavior (and in this sense may seem more "apart" from you than the other subpersonalities). It tends to point out your flaws and limitations whenever possible. It jumps on any mistake you make to remind you that you’re a failure. The Critic generates anxiety by putting you down for not being able to handle your panic symptoms, for not being able to go places you used to go, for being unable to perform at your best, or for having to be dependent on someone else. It also likes to compare you with others and usually sees them coming out favorably. It tends to ignore your positive qualities and emphasizes your weaknesses and inadequacies. The Critic may be personified in your own dialogue as the voice of your mother or father, a dreaded teacher, or anyone who wounded you in the past with their criticism.</p>
		<p><em>Favorite expressions:</em> "What a disappointment you are!" "That was stupid!"
		<p><em>Examples:</em> The following would be typical of the Critic’s self-talk: "You stupid …" (The Critic ­relishes negative labels.) "Can’t you ever get it right?" "Why are you always this way?" "Look at how capable ___________ is," or "You could have done better." The Critic holds negative self-beliefs, such as "I’m inferior to others," "I’m not worth much," "There’s something inherently wrong with me," or "I’m weak—I should be stronger."</p>
		<h3>The Victim (promotes depression)</h3>
		<p><em>Characteristics:</em> The Victim is that part of you that feels helpless or hopeless. It generates anxiety by telling you that you’re not making any progress, that your condition is incurable, or that the road is too long and steep for you to have a real chance at recovering. The Victim also plays a major role in creating depression. The Victim believes that there is something inherently wrong with you: you are in some way deprived, defective, or unworthy. The Victim always perceives insurmountable obstacles between you and your goals. Characteristically, it bemoans, complains, and regrets things as they are at present. It believes that nothing will ever change.</p>
		<p><em>Favorite expressions:</em> "I can’t." "I’ll never be able to."</p>
		<p><em>Examples:</em> The Victim will say such things as "I’ll never be able to do that, so what’s the point in even trying?" "I feel physically drained today—why bother doing anything?" "Maybe I could have done it if I’d had more initiative ten years ago—but it’s too "late now." The Victim holds such negative self-beliefs as "I’m hopeless," "I’ve had this problem too long—it will never get better," or "I’ve tried everything—nothing is ever going to work."</p>
		<h3>The Perfectionist (promotes chronic stress and burnout)</h3>
		<p><em>Characteristics:</em> The Perfectionist is a close cousin of the Critic, but its concern is less to put you down than to push and goad you to do better. It generates anxiety by constantly telling you that your efforts aren’t good enough, that you should be working harder, that you should always have everything under control, should always be competent, should always be pleasing, should always be ___________ (fill in whatever you keep telling yourself that you "should" do or be). The Perfectionist is the ­hard-­driving part of you that wants to be best and is intolerant of mistakes or setbacks. It has a tendency to try to convince you that your self-worth is dependent on externals, such as vocational achievement, money and status, acceptance by others, being loved, or your ability to be pleasing and nice to others, regardless of what they do. The Perfectionist isn’t convinced by any notions of your inherent self-worth, but instead pushes you into stress, exhaustion, and burnout in pursuit of its goals. It likes to ignore ­warning signals from your body.</p>
		<p><em>Favorite Expressions:</em> "I should." "I have to." "I must."</p>
		<p><em>Examples:</em> The Perfectionist may provide such instructions as "I should always be on top of things," "I should always be considerate and unselfish," "I should always be pleasant and nice," or "I have to (get this job, make this amount of money, receive ___________ ’s approval, etc.) or I’m not worth much." (See the discussion of "should statements" at the end of the next section.)</p>
		<h3>Exercise: What Are Your Subpersonalities Telling You?</h3>
		<p>Take some time to think about how each of the above subpersonalities plays a role in your ­thinking, feelings, and behavior. First, estimate how much each one affects you by rating its degree of influence from "not at all" to "very much" on a six-point scale (see the worksheets over the next few pages). Which subpersonality is strongest and which is weakest for you? Then think about what each subpersonality is saying to you to create or aggravate anxiety in each of four different situations.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>Work</em> (on your job, at school, or in other performance situations)</li>
			<li><em>Personal relationships</em> (with your spouse or partner, parents, children, and/or friends)</li>
			<li><em>Anxiety symptoms</em> (on occasions when you experience panic, anxiety, or obsessive-­compulsive symptoms)</li>
			<li><em>Phobic situations</em> (either in advance of facing a phobia or while actually confronting the ­phobic situation)</li>
		</ol>
