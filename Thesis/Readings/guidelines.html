	<h1>Relaxation Guidelines</h1>
	<p>The following guidelines will help you make the most of the deep relaxation in this application:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Practice at least <em>20 minutes per day</em>. Two 20-minute periods are preferable.  Once a day is mandatory for obtaining generalization effects. (You may want to begin your practice with 30-minute periods. As you gain skill in relaxation techniques, you will find that the amount of time you need to experience the relaxation response will decrease.)</li>
		<li>Find a <em>quiet location</em> to practice where you won't be distracted. Turn on airplane mode on your device and use a fan or air conditioner to blot out background noise if necessary.</li>
		<li>Practice at <em>regular times</em>. On awakening, before retiring, or before meals are generally the best times. A consistent daily relaxation routine will increase the likelihood of generalization effects.</li>
		<li>Practice on an <em>empty stomach</em>. Food digestion after meals will tend to disrupt deep relaxation.</li>
		<li>Assume a <em>comfortable position</em>. Your entire body, including your head, should be supported. Sitting up is preferable to lying down if you are feeling tired and sleepy. It's advantageous to experience the full depth of the relaxation response conciously without going to sleep.</li>
		<li><em>Loosen any tight garments</em> and take off shoes, watch, glasses, contact lenses, jewelry, and so on.</li>
		<li>Make a decision not to worry about anything. Give yourself permission to put aside the concerns of the day. Allow taking care of yourself and having peace of mind to take precedence over any of your worries. (Success with relaxation depends on giving peace of mind high priority in your overall scheme of values.)</li>
		<li>Assume a <em>passive, detached attitdude</em>. This is probably the most important element. You want to adopt a "let it happen" attitude and be free of any worry about how well you are performing the technique. Do not <em>try</em> to relax. Do not <em>try</em> to control your body or thoughts. Do not judge your performance. The point is to let go.</li>
