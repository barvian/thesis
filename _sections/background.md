#### Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

Anxiety in itself is not disorderly.  In fact, as Bourne {% include c.html r=0 a=false %} and other authors have noted, anxiety is often considered inevitable in contemporary society.    Worrying can be a useful, appropriate response to challenging situations in everyday life.  It becomes a diagnosable disorder, however, when a person worries excessively about a variety of everyday problems for at least 6 months in a way that noticeably interferes with their normal lives. Physical symptoms of GAD can include fatigue, headaches, nausea, twitching, muscle aches, and irritability; mentally, patients canâ€™t relax, startle easily, and have difficulty falling asleep.
